## Overview

Dashboards can help answer questions like:

- How many workspaces do I have?
- What is the TE version on each of these workspaces?
- How many accounts(AWS, Azure, GCP) do I have across all workspaces?
- How many controls are in Alert (error, alarm, invalid) state across all workspaces?
- How many controls have an age of x hours/days?
- How many mods are installed across all workspaces?

## Getting started

Download and install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh

brew install steampipe
```
